# Chatbot Implementation

This code represents a sophisticated implementation of a chatbot that combines pattern matching techniques akin to ELIZA with modern features, such as sentiment analysis.
It engages users in text-based conversations while providing emotional insights.
It harnesses the TextBlob library to gauge sentiment in user inputs, fostering self-reflection and sharing of feelings.
The code is designed for future enhancement through data analysis, particularly the content stored in CSV files (feedback_data and conversation_data).
This accumulation of user interactions is essential for refining the chatbot's responses and making it more personalized.
Furthermore, the code includes mechanisms to keep records, timestamps, and even invites user feedback, ensuring that it evolves to cater to the users' needs.
The professional and responsive nature of this code signifies a powerful tool for simulating human-like interactions with users, paving the way for potential advancements in the field of conversational AI. The code encompasses elements such as date and time retrieval, user data logging, sentiment analysis, and user feedback integration, offering a comprehensive conversational experience.

## Key Features
- Pattern-based responses to user input
- Sentiment analysis of user's emotional state
- Date and time retrieval
- User feedback collection
- Conversation history recording

### Usage:
- Input "bye" to exit the conversation.
- Input "date and time" to get the current date and time.
- The program saves user prompts for feedback and analysis.
